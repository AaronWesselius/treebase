	abstract = 'Using morphological data and a computerised parsimony program, the Australian genera Anigozanthos and Macropidia (Haemodoraceae) have been analysed cladistically in order to formulate a hypothesis of their phylogenetic relationship. The results are illustrated with two cladograms and indicate that Anigozanthos together with Macropidia form a monophyletic group diagnosed by a string of synapomorphies, with Macropidia fuliginosa being a derived relative of the species of Anigozanthos subgenus Anigozanthos. Consequently, Macropidia fuliginosa is here treated as a section Macropidia of Anigozanthos.'
