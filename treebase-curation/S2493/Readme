This is a new submission added to TreeBASE1, which will eventually 
migrate to TreeBASE2. The S2493 is the legacy study accession number. 
The original submission contained two files that were too big for a 
TreeBASE1 submission, hence they were each subdivided into two parts 
(A and B). Once in TreeBASE2, we should delete the subdivided matrices 
and upload 2 undivided matrices. Also, I am including the appendix of 
the paper which indicates which species names go with which genes 
(= row segments) as well as Genbank accession numbers.
