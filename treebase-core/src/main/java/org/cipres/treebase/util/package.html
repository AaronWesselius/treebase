Utility programs, run standalone or from the command line, typically for importing 
data into the database or for modifying the data that is already there.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
c
<p>The principal class in this package is {@see AuxiliaryDataImporter}.  
It contains a <code>main</code> method which will read the <tt>Dump.txt</tt> file 
supplied by Bill Piel and try to create the studies described therein. </p>

<p>Other classes in this package include the various "Repatriate*" classes, which
find orphaned data in the database and link it back to the objects to which it belongs, 
{@see DestroySubmission}, which completely destroys the submission specified on the command
line, and {@see AnnotateTree}, which adds left-right labels to the nodes in a specified tree object.</p>

<p>Many of these classes are based on {@see Standalone}, which contains utility methods
that set up a Hibernate environment, retrieve required Spring beans, and initiate database
transactions.</p>
