Pending schema patches: 

[To be put in as patches after the storage structure for them is in place in this directory -- VG 2010-02-04]:

* Drop geospot_id_sequence -- there is no corresponding sequence
* Correct PK name in stepmatrixelement and create stepmatrixelement_id_sequence
* Create indexes, as suggested by Bill 2010-02-03 (and maybe later)
