A perl script from Bill to delete treeblocks and the trees inside them. 

Before running, adjust database name and password in delete_treeblock.pl. 

The parameter to provide is the treeblock_id, e.g.:

perl delete_treeblock.pl 12016

... where 12016 is the treeblock_id. You are then asked to confirm the number of trees in the tree block.
