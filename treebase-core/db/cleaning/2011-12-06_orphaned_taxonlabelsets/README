The script delete_orphaned_taxonlabelsets.pl is intended to delete orphaned taxonlabelsets.

As of Dec 6 2012, orphans were being generated as a result of a bug. Our delete treeblock 
function inadvertently failed to include a cleanup step to delete related, but now orphaned, 
taxonlabelset records. The result is studies that (sometimes) generate a "yikes" error when 
you try to get a list of taxa. 

For example, this page generates a Yikes:

http://treebase.org/treebase-web/search/study/taxa.html?id=12037

While this page (after fixing the data with delete_orphaned_taxonlabelsets.pl) does not:

http://treebase-dev.nescent.org/treebase-web/search/study/taxa.html?id=12037

To run the script, first edit lines 12-15 to point to production, then execute. It takes no 
parameters. Example output is provided with "output.txt".
