Pending framework issues 
========================

* Would like a script for getting a current snapshot of the initial (dictionary) data, 
  to be used alongside with the schema snapshot command. 
  [A problem: simply designating some tables as "dictionaries" and others as "facts" would not work -- 
   at least some tables (Phylochar, DiscreteCharState) contains both "dictionary" and "fact" records.]
   
* Automation scripts for tasks, especially patch application, so that the sysadmin does not forget to wrap a transaction. 
  
* A better way for handling ownership and permissions in particular DB instances -- there is 
  too much manual work at the moment.
  
* Less-intrusive permissions/ownership management.  Currently, ownerships and permissions are handled by pg_owner, pg_admin functions that the 
  sysadmin creates in DB after the initial installation.  Consequently, they get into the schema snapshops and have to be removed by hand.


Pending schema patches: 
======================

* Maybe some indices around matrices (in addition to the indices around trees that are already there). 


Pending data cleanups (on staging):
===================================

[Was promised to be done after migration] 

* fixlabels_trans.zip -- removes duplicate taxon labels - email of 2010-03-03


[Could be worthwhile to do PRIOR to Dec 2009 and Feb 2010 migrations.]

* Remove junk, particularly that created by tests

* Known junk: Submission 22 and its related records
    Youjun's email of 2010-01-28: 
     "In table phylotree, many trees do not have a study_id value, but their phylotreenode related to study 22 via table taxonlabel.  
      Their phylotree_id are: 
       1129,1130,1131,1132,     2333,2334,2335,2336,2337,2338,  2339,2340,2341,2343,2556,2557,2686,2726,2727,2787,2788,2789,2790,     
       3446,3671,3766,3767,3901,3902,3903,3904,3905,3906,3907,3908,3909,3910,3911,3912, 4062,4063, 5705,5706,5707,5708,5720,5721,5921,5941,5981,160000022341
       I will delete those trees because their foreign key constrain  prevent me from cleaning up about 10,000 dummy taxonlabel records related to submission 22 
       (study 22 and submission 22 happen to be the same)." 
     VG: these IDs are from end-of-Jan treebasedev; the current treebasestage may have fewer.   

* Replace "owner" nulls (in submission.user_id?) by the special "migration" owner (see Bill's message of around 2010-02-02)
    "Also because we have reverted to an older instance of the data, the migrated records contain have NULL in the user_id of the submission table. This causes null pointer errors for the unit tests. To fix the problem, I did the following:
     1. I created a user with username "migration" and email address "migration@treebase.org". This is the dummy "user" who will now "own" all migrated submissions that lack an owner.
     2. I got the user_id for the "migration" user, and it happened to be 9955
     3. I ran this statement: "UPDATE submission SET user_id = 9955 WHERE user_id IS NULL"
     Now all migrated data belong to the user "migration". "
   Also, see "null->'tb1'; http://www.treebase.org/~piel/taxlabels_fix.zip; Study 22 (Jan 8)"
     
     
     
Data cleanups on production: 
============================

* Synch hibernate_sequence and {sub_matrix,sub_treebaseblock}.collection_id
  [No need if prod is restored from a dump of stage made after ~2010-02-13]
