<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
TreeBASE is a relational database designed to manage and explore information on 
phylogenetic relationships (Sanderson et al., 1993, 1994; Piel et al., 1996; 
Morel, 1996; Piel et al., 2000). It includes phylogenetic trees and data 
matrices, together with information about the relevant publication, taxa, 
morphological and sequence-based characters, and published analyses. 
</p>
<p>
The database is designed to allow retrieval of trees and data from different 
studies so that existing phylogenetic results may be reassessed, compared, 
combined and reused. Applications include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
to locate information on the phylogeny of particular groups of interest.
</li>
<li>
to obtain datasets for studies of character evolution, including general 
patterns across many groups, such as patterns of homoplasy.
</li>
<li>
in studies of biogeography -- to retrieve trees with representatives in 
particular geographical areas.
</li>
<li>
in studies of coevolution -- to retrieve information on host and parasite 
phylogenies.
</li>
<li>
in studies of congruence and combination of data -- to retrieve all molecular 
and morphological phylogenies for particular groups.
</li>
<li>
in studies of phylogenetic methods -- to retrieve all parsimony or maximum 
likelihood reconstructions, for example, or to download datasets of various 
sorts to test methods.
</li>
<li>
to link together trees of particular groups into more inclusive phylogenies.
</li>
<li>
to discover understudied groups -- a resource for students, funding agencies, 
etc.
</li>
<li>
to retrieve phylogenetic information for use in conservation biology and the 
management of natural resources.
</li>
</ul>
