		<h1>Welcome to TreeBASE</h1>
		<p>
			TreeBASE is a repository of phylogenetic information, specifically 
			user-submitted phylogenetic trees and the data used to generate them. 
			TreeBASE accepts all types of phylogenetic data (e.g., trees of species, 
			trees of populations, trees of genes) representing all biotic taxa. 
			Data in TreeBASE are exposed to the public if they are used in a 
			publication that is in press or published in a peer-reviewed 
			scientific journal, book, conference proceedings, or thesis. 
			Data used in publications that are in preparation or in review can be 
			submitted to TreeBASE but are only available to the publication 
			editors or reviewers using a special access code. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As of early 2010, TreeBASE contains 6,500 trees in 2,500 publications 
            written by 4,500 different authors. These trees have 135,000 distinct 
            taxon labels that map to approximately 60,000 distinct taxa.
