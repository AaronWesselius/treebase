		<h1>Welcome to TreeBASE</h1>	
		<p>
		TreeBASE is a repository of phylogenetic information, specifically user-submitted phylogenetic 
		trees and the data used to generate them. TreeBASE accepts all types of phylogenetic data (e.g., 
		trees of species, trees of populations, trees of genes) representing all biotic taxa. Data in 
		TreeBASE are exposed to the public if they are used in a publication that is in press or published 
		in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, book, conference proceedings, or thesis. Data used in 
		publications that are in preparation or in review can be submitted to TreeBASE but are only available 
		to the authors, publication editors, or reviewers using a special access code. TreeBASE is produced and 
		governed by the <a href="http://www.phylofoundation.org" title="Phyloinformatics Research Foundation, Inc.">The Phyloinformatics Research Foundation, Inc.</a></p>

		<p>The current release includes a host of new features and improvements over the previous TreeBASE prototype. New features include:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Richer annotation of metadata (journal DOIs, specimen georeferences, Genbank accession numbers, etc) </li>
		  <li>A mapping between taxon labels and taxonomic names in uBio and NCBI for improved normalization of names</li>
		  <li>The ability to visualize and edit trees using Phylowidget</li>
		  <li>The ability to search on tree topology</li>
		  <li>Persistent and resolvable URIs for data objects in TreeBASE (i.e. studies, trees, matrices)  serve as both globally unique identification numbers and resource locators.  These  can be included in articles and on researcher's websites, making access to TreeBASE data only a click away</li>
		  <li>Data are delivered in several  serializations, including <a href="http:/hackathon.nescent.org/Supporting_NEXUS_Documentation" target="_blank">NEXUS</a> and <a href="http://www.nexml.org" target="_blank">NeXML</a></li>
		  <li> A special URL  gives journal editors and reviewers anonymous advanced access to data</li>
		  <li>Programmatic access to the data using the <a href="http://evoinfo.nescent.org/PhyloWS" target="_blank">PhyloWS API</a>.  Queries are expressed in  URLs using PhyloWS syntax and can return results in RDF as RSS 1.0 feeds, which means that users can set their favorite RSS Reader to fetch all new TreeBASE studies that satisfy a particular query (e.g. return all studies published in &quot;Systematic Biology,&quot; or return all trees that include &quot;Homo sapiens,&quot; etc)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>As of December 2011, TreeBASE contains 2,946 publications written by 6,106 different authors. These studies analyzed 5,717 matrices and resulted in 8,462 trees with 465,762 taxon labels that mapped to 82,043 distinct taxa.</p>	</div>
